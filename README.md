Copied from https://github.com/amirtds/python_editor_wasm

## Goal

Provide a simple-most but usable python environment for novice programmers.

Properties:
1. Client-only mode (no server-side execution necessary, though possible for some features).
2. Support for turtle graphics, possibly a grid-based environment similar to Kara.
3. Usable in kiosk-mode browsers (e.g. locked down test environments such as isTest2).
   * Ability to disable any in-app sharing with other users.
5. Ability to preload source code and file content via deep linking schmeme.
6. Multi-file support (hidden in the initial setup).
7. Simple debugging support.
